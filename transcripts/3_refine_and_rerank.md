- Rhea Banerjee stayed at #4 (score 78 -> 56): does not have new must-have Jest
- Irfan Pathan moved up from #8 to #5 (score 69 -> 50): does not have new must-have Jest; moved up because candidates above lost more points
- Gopal Krishnan moved down from #3 to #6 (score 78 -> 36): does not have new must-have Jest
- Ishaan Kapoor moved down from #2 to #7 (score 79 -> 31): does not have new must-have Jest; 3 years is below the new 5-year minimum
